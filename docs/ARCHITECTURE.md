# System Architecture

## Overview
The Sustainable Landscaping Platform follows a microservices architecture with three main components:

## Components

### 1. Frontend (React/Next.js)
- **Location**: `/frontend`
- **Purpose**: User interface and experience
- **Key Features**:
  - Plant selection wizard
  - Design visualization tools
  - User dashboard
  - Grower directory
  - Educational content

### 2. Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- **Location**: `/backend`
- **Purpose**: Business logic, data management, and API endpoints
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication and management
  - Plant database API
  - Design storage and retrieval
  - Grower partnership management
  - Payment processing integration

### 3. AI Engine (Python)
- **Location**: `/ai-engine`
- **Purpose**: Machine learning and recommendation algorithms
- **Key Features**:
  - Plant recommendation algorithms
  - Image analysis for existing landscapes
  - Design generation
  - Climate and soil analysis

## Data Flow

```
User Input → Frontend → Backend API → AI Engine
                ↓           ↓          ↓
            User Interface ← Database ← ML Models
```

## Database Design

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Profile, preferences, projects
- **Plants**: Species data, care requirements, ecological benefits
- **Designs**: User-created landscape designs
- **Growers**: Partner nurseries and suppliers
- **Regions**: Geographic and climate data

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Next.js for SSR/SSG
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form management
- React Query for state management

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database
- Prisma ORM
- JWT authentication
- Stripe for payments

### AI Engine
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML
- Pandas for data processing
- FastAPI for ML API endpoints
- scikit-learn for recommendation algorithms

## Security Considerations
- JWT token authentication
- HTTPS everywhere
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Database query protection
- Environment variable management

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- CDN for static assets
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies (Redis)
- Load balancing ready
